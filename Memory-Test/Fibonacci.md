# Fibonacci number

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that
each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

   F0 = 0 , F1 = 1 ,

and

   F n = F n - 1 + F n - 2 ,
     

for n > 1.

The beginning of the sequence is thus:

   0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 55 , 89 , 144 , …
    

In some older books, the value F0 = 0  is omitted, so that the sequence starts with F1 = F2 = 1 ,  
and the recurrence F n = F n - 1 + F n - 2  is valid for n > 2.

Fibonacci numbers are strongly related to the golden ratio: Binet's formula expresses the nth Fibonacci number in terms 
of n and the golden ratio, and implies that the ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers tends to the golden ratio as 
n increases.

Fibonacci numbers are named after Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, later known as Fibonacci. 
In his 1202 book Liber Abaci, Fibonacci introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics, although the sequence 
had been described earlier in Indian mathematics, as early as 200 BC in work by Pingala on enumerating possible patterns
 of Sanskrit poetry formed from syllables of two lengths.

Fibonacci numbers appear unexpectedly often in mathematics, so much so that there is an entire journal dedicated to 
their study, the Fibonacci Quarterly. Applications of Fibonacci numbers include computer algorithms such as the 
Fibonacci search technique and the Fibonacci heap data structure, and graphs called Fibonacci cubes used for 
interconnecting parallel and distributed systems.

They also appear in biological settings, such as branching in trees, the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the fruit 
sprouts of a pineapple, the flowering of an artichoke, an uncurling fern, and the arrangement of a pine cone's bracts.
